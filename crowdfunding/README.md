# Project #4: GoFundMe Web3 DApp

## Overview:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a **decentralized application (DApp) for crowdfunding**, akin to platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, on the Solana blockchain. Users will have the ability to initiate crowdfunding campaigns for causes they support, with the entire process facilitated through smart contracts and program logic implemented on the Solana blockchain.

A Solana **program** is essentially a piece of code that executes on the Solana blockchain. However, due to the immutable nature of blockchain, programs cannot directly store data. Instead, they create **accounts** (similar to files) on the blockchain to store relevant data. The program retrieves necessary information from these accounts to execute its functions.

Building upon the concept of accounts, the project introduces the notion of **program-derived accounts**. In the context of crowdfunding, where funds need to be disbursed, these accounts play a crucial role. When funds are to be distributed, the crowdfunding account, being a program-derived account, seeks permission from a controlling program. This ensures a secure permissions process for transferring funds within the decentralized ecosystem.
