# Stake your $SOL with JavaScript

## Section 1: Intro
Enter a new Umbuntu terminal and navigate to a folder of your choice.

```
mkdir staking
```

This folder will store all of our staking code. Now Cd into the folder.

```
cd staking
```

Then we will create a node project because we want to import the solana/web3.js library.  

```
npm init -y
```

Now we can also install the solana/web3.js library. 

```
 npm install --save @solana/web3.js
```
