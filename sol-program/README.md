# PROJECT #3: CUSTOM SOLANA PROGRAM

**OVERVIEW:** 

This project aims to develop a **decentralized application (DApp)** featuring a **calculator** implemented in **Rust**. We'll create a test using Mocha written in JavaScript, ensuring robust code validation. The following is necessary **prerequisites**—Node.js, Solana, Rust, Anchor, and Mocha—have been outlined and documented in the initial ReadMe.md of this repository.

**INTRO:**

In the context of Solana, **programs represent the code executed on the Solana Blockchain**. Notably, Solana programs are inherently "stateless," signifying their inability to store data. To circumvent this limitation, the solution involves the utilization of accounts. These **accounts serve as virtual "files" stored on the Solana Blockchain**, enabling essential data storage for the calculator DApp. This approach ensures efficient data management within the Solana ecosystem while adhering to the platform's architectural principles.

## Set-up
 Open a new terminal window and let's initialize our anchor project `anchor init app-name`. Once the anchor project is initialized let's test to see if everything is working fine.

 ```
anchor init sol-program
```

And open the project in VScode; 
1. Navigate to the Remote Explorer 
2. Select the `sol-program` you just created.
3. Navigate to `programs/sol-program/src/lib.rs`
