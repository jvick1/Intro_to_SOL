# PROJECT #3: CUSTOM SOLANA PROGRAM

**OVERVIEW:** 

This project aims to develop a **decentralized application (DApp)** featuring a **calculator** implemented in **Rust**. We'll create a test using Mocha written in JavaScript, ensuring robust code validation. The following is necessary **prerequisites**—Node.js, Solana, Rust, Anchor, and Mocha—have been outlined and documented in the initial ReadMe.md of this repository.

**INTRO:**

In the context of Solana, **programs represent the code executed on the Solana Blockchain**. Notably, Solana programs are inherently "stateless," signifying their inability to store data. To circumvent this limitation, the solution involves the utilization of accounts. These **accounts serve as virtual "files" stored on the Solana Blockchain**, enabling essential data storage for the calculator DApp. This approach ensures efficient data management within the Solana ecosystem while adhering to the platform's architectural principles.
